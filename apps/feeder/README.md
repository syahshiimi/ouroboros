# Feeder
In the most conceptual sense, the feeder is the agent that feeds the ouroboros, the conceptual engine that drives the way we wish to think  about artworks being produced through events. These artworks however, are not exactly envisioned as visual outputs, rather, as behaviours as a consequence of events that happened in real-life.

For the most part, the *feeder's* role as the name suggest is to *feed* the ouroboros. The ouroboros is a self-induced, self-eating, self-fulfilling prophecy on modelling forecasting the weather through data as the source of truth. 

Acting as the source of truth, these data points can be used to drive specific behaviours and therefore *events*. 

## Run locally
```bash
pnpm dev --filter=@ouroboros/feeder
